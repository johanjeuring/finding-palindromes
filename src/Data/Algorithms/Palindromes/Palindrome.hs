{- An example text Palindrome from plain input string "bab..ac" is
(Palindrome 5 3 "ab..a" (1,6)). The center is on the 'b' and has center index 5. The
pre-processed text palindrome is "aba", so the length is 3, and after adding back
punctuation, the start character index is 1 (the first 'a') and the end character index
is 6 (the 'c' after the second 'a'). The string representing this text palindrome is
"ab..a". -}
