This module Contains two functions that run algorithms for finding palindromes.
One runs a linear time algorithms and the other a quadratic algorithm.
These assume text has been preprocessed.
They return a list with the length of the maximal palindrome at each center index.

{- | Search for palindromes using the quadratic algorithm. Returns a list of the maximum
length palindromes which were found at each center index in the input. Gaps allow the
palindrome to have a gap at the center of given length. Errors allow some substitution
mistakes in the palindrome.
