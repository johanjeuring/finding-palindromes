This module exports three functions that run algorithms for finding palindromes:
1. The linear algorithm (for finding palindromes in linear time).
2. The quadratic algorithm (for finding palindromes in quadratic time).
3. The Approximate Palindrome algorithm for finding approximate palindromes.
These assume text has been preprocessed.

More information about what features the algorithms support is in the README.md.

the maximal palindromes which were found at each center from the input. Gaps allow the
palindrome to have a gap at the center of given length. Errors allow some substitution
mistakes in the palindrome.
