This module exports three functions that run algorithms for finding palindromes in Vectors:
1. The linear algorithm (for finding palindromes in linear time).
2. The quadratic algorithm (for finding palindromes in quadratic time).
3. The Approximate Palindrome algorithm for finding approximate palindromes. This algorithm also runs in quadratic time

More information about what features the algorithms support is in the README.md.

{- | Search for palindromes using the quadratic algorithm. Returns a list of lengths of
the maximal palindromes which were found at each center from the input. Gaps allow the
palindrome to have a gap at the center of given length. Errors allow some substitution
errors in the palindrome.

    if we have an even-sized gap and an anti-reflexive datatype.

    {- ^ Represents the size of a gap in the center when looking for palindromes.
    This means that the middle X characters will be ignored at every center.
