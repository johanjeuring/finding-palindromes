This module Contains two functions that run algorithms for finding palindromes.
One runs a linear time algorithms and the other a quadratic algorithm.
These assume text has been preprocessed.
They return the max length of the palindrome at each center index.

{-- | Search for palindromes using the quadratic algorithm.
Returns a list of a list of the maximum length palindrome that was found at each center index in the input.
Gaps allow the palindrome to have a gap at the center of given length, errors allow n mistakes in the palindrome of given Int.
