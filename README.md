This is the repository for the Haskell finding Palindromes Package originally made by Johan Jeuring

# Installation

To clone the repository either use an SSH key with the SHH link under the Code button.

Or to use HTTPS open a terminal in the location you want to clone to and use the command:
```
git clone https://git.science.uu.nl/ics/sp/2025/v25b/finding-palindromes-package.git
```
This should then prompt for a login where you need to use your UU credentials (Solis ID) this should allow you to login

# Autoformatting with fourmolu

For Fourmolu you need a modern version of ghc. The base version needs to be atleast 4.19 so the GHC version should be atleast 9.8.2. 

Then to install fourmolu run
```
cabal install fourmolu
```
Make sure cabal.bin is added to the path
