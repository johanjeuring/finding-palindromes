In version 0.4, the following features have been added/removed:

- The package does not provide functionality for finding odd-length
DNA palindromes anymore.
- The package provides functionality for determining approximate
palindromes and palindromes with gaps. This is a naive algorithm 
with worst-case quadratic-time behavior. This behavior shows up 
when the input consists of many copies of the same letter. In 
practice, the worst-case quadratic-time algorithm is always 
faster than the worst-case linear-time algorithm.

For more information, consult the README file in the distribution.
